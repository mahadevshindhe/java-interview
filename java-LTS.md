# Java LTS Versions: Details, Best Practices
Java Long Term Support (LTS) versions are special releases that Oracle and the OpenJDK community have committed to supporting for a longer period of time compared to the standard feature releases. LTS versions are typically supported for several years and receive updates for security, stability, and performance. They are ideal for enterprises and applications where stability and long-term viability are of paramount importance.

1. **Java SE 8 (LTS)**
   - Version Number: 8
   - Release Date: March 2014
   - Duration of Support: Public updates for Oracle JDK 8 were available until January 2019 without a commercial license. However, Oracle will continue to provide updates under a paid support plan until at least December 2030. OpenJDK 8 support varies by provider.

2. **Java SE 11 (LTS)**
   - Version Number: 11
   - Release Date: September 2018
   - Duration of Support: Oracle JDK 11 will receive updates under a paid support plan until at least September 2026. OpenJDK 11 support also varies by provider.

3. **Java SE 17 (LTS)**
   - Version Number: 17
   - Release Date: September 2021
   - Duration of Support: Oracle has committed to providing updates for JDK 17 under a paid support plan until at least September 2029. OpenJDK 17 support durations will differ among providers.

Future LTS versions are planned as part of the new release cadence established by Oracle and the OpenJDK community, with a new LTS version expected every three years.

**Significance of LTS Versions:**
LTS versions are significant because they offer a stable foundation for developers and enterprises that do not wish to frequently update their Java platform. This stability is crucial for large-scale, critical applications that require a reliable and secure environment with minimal changes over time.

**Best Practices for Developers:**
- **Assess Application Requirements:** Choose an LTS version if your application requires long-term stability and you wish to minimize the frequency of mandatory updates.
- **Consider Support Plans:** If you are using Oracle JDK, be aware of the support timeline and consider purchasing a support plan if necessary. Alternatively, you can use an OpenJDK distribution that offers extended support for LTS versions.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up to date with the release and support schedules for Java versions, as these can influence your decision-making process.
- **Test Regularly:** When planning to upgrade to a new LTS version, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility and performance.
- **Security Updates:** Regardless of whether you are on an LTS or non-LTS version, always apply security updates as soon as possible to protect your applications from vulnerabilities.

By following these best practices, developers can effectively leverage Java LTS versions to build and maintain robust, long-lived applications.
